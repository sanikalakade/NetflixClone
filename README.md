# Netflix Clone

A simple Netflix Clone project designed using only HTML and CSS to replicate the basic layout and design of Netflix's homepage.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive and mobile-friendly layout.
- **HTML & CSS Only**: Built purely with HTML and CSS, no JavaScript or backend functionality.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures the design works seamlessly across all modern browsers.
- **Clean and Organized Code**: Easy-to-read and well-documented HTML and CSS files.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and view the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sanikalakade/NetflixClone.git
  NetflixClone
   ```

2. **Open in Browser**:

   Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to view the project.

3. **Customize the Design** (Optional):

   You can edit the CSS and HTML files to personalize the design or add new features.




## How It Works

This project is a static implementation, meaning it does not include interactivity or backend functionality. The main goal is to replicate the visual layout of Netflix using fundamental web development techniques.

- The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage.
- The 'style.css' directory includes the styling rules to match the Netflix theme.
- All images and assets are stored in the `images/` directory for easy access.


## Future Improvements

- Add interactivity with JavaScript to enable features like a working search bar and carousel.
- Enhance responsiveness for larger screens and smaller devices.
- Incorporate animations and hover effects for a better user experience.
